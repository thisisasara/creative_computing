		<h3>This project examines the relation between text-only books and the reading experience.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The project first explores the science behind printed texts through research on text legibility, visual accuracy, reading speed, and the use of eye movement. The results of this inquiry are explored in a prototype of an ideal text-only book design that offers the best reading experience with functionality and feasibility in mind.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The second part builds on this research and proposes ideas of non-traditional ways to improve the reading experience through interaction and the utilization of eye movement to eliminate fatigue.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The third part breaks away from the traditions, orders, and norms that we take for granted in a book, for instance, the form of the book itself. It encourages the audience to step out of these rules and reassess their expectations of the world.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		By examining the notion of reading and forms of books through three aspects: traditional, innovative, and conceptual, this project strives to build a dynamic understanding and new thinking regarding the long-established subject. This project is informed by my seminar paper Cultural Investigation of Typography Use in Branding in America through its investigation of typefaces, fonts, and typography.<br>
	</p>

		The text used throughout the book is The Lottery by Shirley Jackson which is a short story that criticizes the tendency of blindly following traditions.</h3><br>
